## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing manufacturing efficiency through data-driven insights using Power BI.
The analysis was performed for ProManu Analytics, a consultancy firm specializing in manufacturing analytics.

Two datasets were provided:

Manufacturing Production Data â€“ covering product details (production dates, costs, quantities, warehouse locations).

Employee Performance Metrics â€“ covering employee details (departments, salaries, performance ratings, training, and countries of operation).

The project integrates these datasets to uncover trends, optimize resource allocation, and improve workforce productivity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Analyze production data to identify cost patterns and efficiency gaps.

* Explore employee performance metrics across departments, salaries, and training.

* Develop advanced DAX measures for cost efficiency, correlation, and forecasting.

* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard that tells a story with insights.

## ðŸ”§ Data Preparation & Modeling

1.**Data Cleaning** â€“ Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data.

2.**Data Modeling** â€“ Created relationships between ProductID in both datasets.

3.**Transformations** â€“ Normalized data types, categorized product types, and extracted training details.

4.**DAX Measures** â€“

* Average Production Cost by Product Type

* Average Performance Rating by Department

* Salary Trends over Time

* Cost Efficiency (Production Cost per Unit)

* Production vs Employee Performance Correlation

*  Predictive Demand Modeling

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses

* **Production Costs**: Highest and lowest costs by product type & country.

* **Employee Distribution**: Employee counts by department and country.

* **Performance Ratings**: Avg. ratings per department and correlation with salary.

* **Warehouse Utilization**: Avg. quantity stored by location.

* **Salary Trends**: Increases/disparities across time.

* **Manufacturing Trends**: Seasonal production trends per product type.

* **Employee Tenure**: Analysis of employee experience distribution.

* **Training Records**: Extracted training dates & types for workforce analysis.

* **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicted production costs for the next quarter.

* **Anomaly Detection**: Identified unusual production spikes/costs.

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features

The Power BI Dashboard includes:

* **ðŸ“Œ Production Insights** â€“ costs, quantities, and efficiency.

* **ðŸ“Œ Employee Analytics** â€“ department-wise distribution, salary trends, performance ratings.

* **ðŸ“Œ Geographical Analysis** â€“ Country of Origin vs. Country of Operation.

* **ðŸ“Œ Time-based Analysis** â€“ production trends & salary progression.

* **ðŸ“Œ Advanced KPIs** â€“ cost efficiency, predictive demand modeling, and correlation measures.

* **ðŸ“Œ Interactive Filters** â€“ by Department, Country, and Product Type.

* **ðŸ“Œ Key Insights Section** â€“ storytelling with highlights of critical findings.
